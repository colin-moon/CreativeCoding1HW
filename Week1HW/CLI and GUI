The difference between CLI and GUI is how it allows the user to interact with it. CLI stands for command line interface which means the user must type out command lines in order to complete actions. This is more difficult and takes more skill to memorize the differnent command lines however, it is faster than GUI at most tasks. Additionaly CLI is more effiecient at completing repetitive tasks and can be more precise. GUI stands for graphical user interface and is a more user friendy interface that allows the user to complete the same tasks as CLI does but with the use of buttons and menus. This means that its easier to use as a beginner however, it comes at a couple of setbacks. GUI often takes longer to complete the same task as it's CLI counterpart because it requires the user to click on icons and buttons. Additionally, GUIs are harder to run because the system has to load the different icons. Due to their ease of use, GUIs are more popular than CLIs as the average person might use them on a day to day basis.
