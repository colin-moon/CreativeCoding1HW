I’ve heard a lot of people talk about obstacles and challenges when trying to achieve a goal. Pausch calls them “brick walls”. Most people (including Pausch) say that there will always be obstacles no matter what you are trying to achieve. That they’re simply a part of life. We must overcome these roadblocks in order to succeed or to get to the next one. I agree with this. However, Pausch way of explaining them really stuck with me. He said that they aren’t obstacles, but opportunities to prove to ourselves, how badly we want to achieve our dreams. This connects into the growth mindset and taking failure or roadblocks as a way to see how you can improve.
