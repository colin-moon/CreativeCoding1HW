I agree with the article’s main point that learning styles don’t actually translate with someone’s ability to learn. While I do have a preference when I’m trying to learn a topic, another method hasn’t ever impacted the way or the speed at which I learn it. If everyone could only learn their best in their preferred method, then teachers would have to conform to all of their learning styles simultaneously which is inefficient. Instead the article emphasizes that a style that suits everyone and is actually beneficial is what we need.
