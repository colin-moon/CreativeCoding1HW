For my final project I want build off my previous work and create a game. The game will consist of a maze along with moving obstacles. The objective is to escape the maze without hitting any of the obstacles. Additionally, I will make it so you can't touch the walls of the maze. If you hit an obstacle or a wall you lose. My idea was inspired by retro arcade games. I also want to create a custom background instead of it having it be a solid color. I'm also going to have to figure out how to incorporate collision into my game so that hitting the walls and the obstacles reset you. Additionally, I will need to spend some time creating the background. I'll start with the coding first and then focus on the visuals. This will ensure that I don't have to rush the coding and can take my time on that as it's more important the game works rather than looks good. That said, I'll make sure I leave myself at least a day to create the background.
