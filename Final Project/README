For my final project I want build off my previous work and create a game. The game will consist of a maze that will be randomized along with moving obstacles. The objective is to escape the maze without hitting any of the obstacles. Additionally, I will make it so you can't touch the walls of the maze. If you hit an obstacle or a wall you lose and the maze randomizes again. My idea was inspired by retro arcade games so I also want to create a custom background instead of it having it be a solid color. I'm also going to have to figure out how randomize the maze each time it is run and also spend some time creating the background. I'll start with the coding first and then focus on the visuals. This will ensure that I don't have to rush the coding and can take my time on that as it's more important the game works rather than looks good. That said, I'll make sure I leave myself at least a day to create the background.
