For my final project I want build off my previous work and create a game. The game will consist of a maze along with moving obstacles. The objective is to escape the maze without hitting any of the obstacles. Additionally, I will make it so you can't touch the walls of the maze. If you hit an obstacle or a wall you lose. My idea was inspired by retro arcade games. I'm going to have to figure out how to incorporate collision into my game so that hitting the walls and the obstacles reset you. Additionally, I will need to spend some time making the colors match and the overall game look visually appealing. I'll start with the coding first and then focus on the visuals. This will ensure that I don't have to rush the coding and can take my time on that as it's more important the game works rather than looks good. That said, I'll make sure I leave myself at least a day for the visuals.
